## Description

An example of a calculator application created using HTML, CSS, & JavaSCript. A user can add, subtract, multiply, and divide using the operator buttons on the calculator.

This project uses JavaScript math functions, actionListners on the buttons, a forEach method to add different functions to each button and DOM manipulation to update the calculator display.
